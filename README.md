# Analyses of _Agave_ growth and survivorship

This repository holds code and data for analyses of a variety of treatments 
investigating the relationship between Lehmann lovegrass, _Eragrostis 
lehmanniana_, and agave, _Agave_ sp.

The three primary questions are:

1. How do various treatments affect agave survival and growth, where:
    + survival is measured by the number of live plants in a row, and
    + growth is measured by the number of leaves from three plants in a row
2. How do the weed-eating and hand-pulling treatments affect agave growth and 
percent cover of Lehmann lovegrass?
3. How does percent cover of Lehmann lovegrass affect agave survival and growth?
