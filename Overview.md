From E. Gornish:

There are 6 plots (reps). In each large plot, ten rows of agave were planted (20 plants per row) in a lehmann lovegrass (invasive plant) dominated field. Each row is a different treatment. Treatment codes are:

J = javelina protection with chicken wire
S = shade cloth
W = lehmanns control via weed eating
H = lehmanns control via hand pulling
J+S = javelin protection with chicken wire AND shade cloth
J+W = javelin protection with chicken wire AND lahmanns control via weed eating
S+W = Shade cloth AND lehmanns control via weed eating
W+H = lehmanns control via weed eating AND lehmanns control via hand pulling
C = control (no treatment applied)

Agave seedlings were planted in the spring and last month, Amy measured a few things:

1. On each agave, amy noted if the plant was prewdated upon (was munched by javelina), was dead or was alive and not predated upon.
2. One THREE agave per row (out of ten), amy measured the number of live leaves. If there were not enough live plants (as is the case mostly, most of our agaves died or were really badly chewed), then no leaves were measured.
3. On each agave planting (ten per row), amy assessed the amount of lehmanns aerial cover in a meter squared quadrat (with the quadrat centered on the agave)

So, the questions are :

1. How do the treatments affect agave survival (function of live or dead of all plants per row) and growth (function of leaf number in three plants per row)
2. How do the W and H treatments and agave size affect lehmanns cover?
3. How does lehmanns cover affect agave survival and growth (if there are enough degrees of freedom â€“ lehmanns cover can be included as a covariate in the model for #1).

We would need the analysis completed plus necessary graphs.
